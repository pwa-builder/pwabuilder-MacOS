## PWAInfo
The [PWAInfo](https://github.com/pwa-builder/pwabuilder-MacOS/tree/base-project/MacOSpwa/PWAinfo) directory contains a sample manifest and image icons of various requried sizes. [PWABuilder](https://www.pwabuilder.com) will be modified so that it replaces the sample manifest and image icons with those of your own PWA.
